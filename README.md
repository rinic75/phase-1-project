# phase-1-project : Food Finder

## Description

  Food Finder is the project from Flatiron School. I used public API from 'https://www.edamam.com/' to find the food and its ingredients. You can search for food in your mind with meal time selection. You can see the ingredients when you click a list of food names. Also, we can sort the result into diets such as balanced, low carb, low fat, and so on.
